<h1>Animate.scss</h1>

<p>This is a port of Dan Eden&rsquo;s <a href="http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a> for SASS.</p>

<h2>Doesn&rsquo;t this already exist somewhere else?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are plenty of other ports of this library. Many of them aren&rsquo;t very active projects and, honestly, I was just a little too lazy to submit my changes to those repositories.</p>

<p>Also, I was looking for something a little more flexible. This version allows you to import all animations at a whopping 53kb or only import what you need. It&rsquo;s a flavor thing.</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>The default import includes all animations.</p>

<p><code>
@import "animate.scss";
</code></p>

<p>Want to pick and choose which animations are imported? Go into animate.scss and comment out what you don&rsquo;t need.</p>

<p>```
// Always required
@import
  &ldquo;_properties&rdquo;;</p>

<p>// Import the animations
@import
  // &ldquo;<em>attention/attention.scss&rdquo;, // This will not import
  &ldquo;</em>bouncing-entrances/bouncing-entrances.scss&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;<em>bouncing-exits/bouncing-exits.scss&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;</em>fading-entrances/fading-entrances.scss&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;<em>fading-exits/fading-exits.scss&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;</em>flippers/flippers.scss&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;<em>lightspeed/lightspeed.scss&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;</em>rotating-entrances/rotating-entrances.scss&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;<em>rotating-exits/rotating-exits.scss&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;</em>specials/specials.scss&rdquo;;
<code>``
You only want one of two of the animations? You can</code>@import<code>the specific partials in animate.scss instead (Example:</code>@import &ldquo;<em>attention/</em>bounce&rdquo;;`).</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once your files have been added to your project and you&rsquo;ve customized your <code>@imports</code>, you can start including the animations directly to your classes.</p>

<p><code>
.your-class-name {
  @include bounceIn();
}
</code></p>

<p>The mixin includes configurable options to customize the <code>delay</code>, <code>count</code> <code>duration</code>, <code>function</code> and <code>fill-mode</code> of your animations.</p>

<p><code>
.your-class-name {
  @include bounceIn(
    $duration: 1s,
    $count: 2,
    $delay: .2s,
    $function: ease,
    $fill: both
  );
}
</code></p>

<h2>Just Want the CSS?</h2>

<p>You can have that too. Link up animate.css to your document <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and add the animations like you would any class name.</p>
